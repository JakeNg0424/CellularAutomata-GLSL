Since Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automata, my source of inspiration was in the name itself: `cells`. Living microscopic cells to be exact. Their chaotic unpredictable movements along with their ability to divide themselves through mitosis fit perfectly to Conwayâ€™s Game of Life.

To achieve the microorganisms sporadic behavior, I coded a 5 by 5 grid or 25 neighbors layout for more opportunities in GLSL for the cells to multiply as finding contact to another cell became more propable.

Next, I also wanted to make the visual more natural and living by adding distortion as well as embossing it to make it look like the cells are being viewed through a microscope.
